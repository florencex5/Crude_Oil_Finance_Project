# Crude_Oil_Finance_Project

### The Problem: 
- What insights can be gleaned from the variance in crude oil prices within the context of oligopoly market?
### Data and Methods Used
- Exploring correlation for crude oil WTI, US automakers & US oil companies
- Building Machine Learning Model for forecasting crude oil WTI thereby to enhance the comprehension of risk exposure
- Analyzing U.S. automakersâ€™ financial performance in the context of crude oil WTI fluctuations
  - Financial Measure Tableau Dashboard ([Link Reference](https://public.tableau.com/views/FinancialMeasures/FinancialDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))
  - Full financial analysis is created as separate pdf file (File Name: Financial_Analysis_Tableau_Dashboard)
- Time Series Analysis of U.S. greenhouse gas emission

### Data Source
- United States Environmental Protection Agency
- Federal Reserve Economic Data
- Alpha Vantage API
- US Energy Information Administration
- U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission API

### Key Findings:
- **Crude oil (oligopoly market) + automaker (cyclical company) + climate change (global issue) = COLLABORATION**
- The stock prices of oil companies and automaker is sensitive to the fluctuations in oil price
- XGBoost model demonstrates strong performance, with R-squared (R2) values exceeding 90%. This indicates that over 90% of the variability in weekly crude oil WTI prices can be accounted for by the model.
- While these statistical metrics are strong indicators that the model fits the data well and captures a significant portion of the price fluctuations, it is crucial to incorporate additional relevant features, such as commodities trading activities, to achieve more meaningful R- squared (R2) scores. This approach will enhance both the statistical robustness and financial significance of the model.
- Cyclical companies face limitations on profit growth tied to broader economic conditions, especially in long-term.
- Balancing environmental objectives with economic stability is paramount. A robust economy and a sustainable environment must coexist, as an imbalance would have long-term repercussions for all stakeholders. Achieving this equilibrium necessitates collaborative efforts among oil companies, automakers, and government entities.
- The sharp rise in crude oil prices can have a cascading impact, resulting in elevated diesel and gasoline prices. This, in turn, can trigger a ripple effect, leading to increased costs for delivery services, higher product prices, reduced consumer spending, and ultimately, a dampening effect on economic growth. Consequently, cyclical industries such as automakers can also be adversely affected.
- To expedite the transition to a hydrogen-based economy, the responsibility for building a robust infrastructure should not fall solely on one party.Collaboration and shared responsibility among stakeholders are essential for achieving this goal efficiently and effectively.
